# Log Archive Tool

> [!WARNING]
> The development and experimentation of this tool has moved to the [lab repository](https://github.com/lethanix/lab). 

The script will accept the log directory as an argument, compress the logs, and store them in a new directory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lethanix/log-archive-tool.git
```

2. Modify permissions to make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x log-archive.sh
```

3. Run the script with the log directory as the first argument
```bash
./log-archive.sh <log-directory>
```
